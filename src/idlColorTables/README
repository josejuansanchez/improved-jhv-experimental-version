IDL Color Tables
-- Helper scripts to create GIMP gradient files from idl tables

In the solor physics community color tables are mostly stored as some idl
function, like the aia color tables. To enable a easy conversion this
includes some scripts trying to fit it into a gimp gradient file.

It also includes the original aia color tables (aia_lct.pro) and
the STEREO color tables.

To fit some data for a color table see fit_gimp.pro.

I just learnt IDL today so the script is very hacky. Also it just
aids you to convert it and does not do any kind of automatic transformation.
