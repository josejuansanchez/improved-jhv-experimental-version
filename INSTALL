*  JHelioviewer INSTALL  *
**************************

JHelioviewer is written in Java. In order to build the whole project you need
Apache Ant.  However Eclipse can be used during the development phase.

JHelioviewer uses the version control system Bazaar in order to keep track of
revisions, releases, milestones, bugs and blueprints.

The source code is hosted on Launchpad:

https://launchpad.net/jhelioviewer

This document serves only as a quick reference for building the source code.
More detailed instructions as well as development guidelines and information can
be found on:

Build instructions
-------------------

I) Get the source code. There are two alternatives:
   
   a) Get the latest trunk using Bazaar (http://bazaar.canonical.com/en/):
   
        1.) Install Bazaar
        
        2.) Choose a destination directory for the source code

	3.) Open a terminal and type: 

            bzr branch lp:jhelioviewer ${PATH_TO_DESTINATION_DIRECTORY}

   b) Get the source code of the latest release from
		http://www.jhelioviewer.org/ and extract the archive to a
		directory of your choice

II) Build the source code with Ant (http://ant.apache.org/)

    1.) Open a terminal and change to the directory containing the source code
	and the ant buildfile (build.xml)

    2.) The following ant targets exist

           ant                   - just builds JHelioviewer.jar

	   ant release-all       - builds all release files for all platforms
	                           including JHelioviewer.jar and a package
	                           containing the source code. DMGs can only be
	                           built on MacOS. Note that you need to have
	                           checked out the source with bazaar in order
	                           to package the source code
			
           ant release-no-src    - the same as release-all except that the
	                           source code is not packaged.  Use this if you
	                           downloaded the source from the website
	      
           ant release-windows   - build JHelioviewer-Setup.exe

           ant release-tar       - build JHelioviewer.tar.gz
			
           ant release-mac       - build JHelioviewer.dmg containing
                                   JHelioviewer.app

           ant doc               - build the java documentation

           ant clean             - delete temporary build files. You should only
			           do this when necessary because the build
			           process is much faster if not all files have
			           to be built again

III) Other Notes

    1.)  If you want to start JHelioviewer from a JNLP file from inside a web
	 browser you need to sign JHelioviewer.jar
	 (http://java.sun.com/developer/technicalArticles/Programming/jnlp/). To
	 do so you can set a special property when starting ant:

	   ant -Dsign.jar=true release-all
	
         You will be asked for your keystore, keystore password, alias and
	 private key password during the build process. Alternatively you can
	 pass these information as properties:
			
           ant -Dsign.jar=true "-Dsign.keystore=${MY_KEY_STORE}" \
               "-Dsign.storepass=${MY_STORE_PASSWORD}" \
               "-Dsign.alias=${MY_ALIAS}" \
               "-Dsign.keypass=${MY_KEY_PASSWORD}" \
               release-all
	
    2.)  If you do not want to recompile the source code and just want to bundle
	 the existing binaries type:

           ant bundle-all        - generates all release files including source
                                   code package)
	   
           ant bundle-no-src     - the same as bundle-all except that the source
                                   code is not packaged)
	
           ant bundle-windows
	
           ant bundle-mac
	
           ant bundle-tar
	
    3.)  In order to just bundle the source code type:

	   ant bundle-src
		

Eclipse
---------

You can also import JHelioviewer in Eclipse.

1.) IMPORTANT: You have to generate some parts of the source code before you can
    build the project in Eclipse: To do so go to the source code directory from
    within a terminal and type:

		ant precompile

2.) Open Eclipse and make the jhelioviewer directory the working directory

3.) Open the 'Import...' dialog and select the option to import an existing
project

4.) Choose the current working directory as the root directory
