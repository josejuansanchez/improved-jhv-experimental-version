Workspace mechanics -- For Eclipse Development

To ensure that the formatter and tab setting are consistent in each commit,
we use workspacemechanic from:
http://code.google.com/a/eclipselabs.org/p/workspacemechanic/

For a quick start, just go to "Help->Install New Software..." and select
the site:
http://workspacemechanic.eclipselabs.org.codespot.com/hg.update/mechanic
After following the instruction and selecting Workspace Mechanic it will be
installed for your eclipse installation.

The used settings are in this folder:
tab_space.epf - Setting tab to four space
formatter.epf - Sets the java formatter

To use them just copy the files to ~/.eclipse/mechanic and the settings will
be checked at the next startup. You can also use install.sh which does the
job

BUGS/PROBLEMS
Setting the formatter options such that format will yield the right result is
properly done, see formatter.epf how to create the settings. However, editing
the gui for the selection properly, is not working at the moment and I have no
idea how to do it.
